## 12/31/2025 4:21 AM - Selecting the microprocessor   

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I started with selecting best Microcontroller
there are many MCU avalibable in market 
but i select the ESP32-s3 because there Wide range of communication With Many protocols Including wifi and bLE Which made it a best choice.

## 12/31/2025 4:25 AM - best deal  

_Time spent: 0.2h_  

It is easily available on Platforms like LCSC Electronics Which implies it can be easily assembled IN PCBA And second it is Only cost $3 something Which made them very Good MCU

## 12/31/2025 4:52 AM - Start designing Systematic  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

So after finalising the microcontroller I start preparing I'm systematic
STARTING WITH ESP32-S3R8

USE THE OFFICAL [espressif DOCS](https://documentation.espressif.com/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf)  

## 12/31/2025 6 AM - MCU CONNECTED   

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

FINALLY AFTER 2.3HOUR WORK THE MCU PINOUT, Timer Crystal CONNECTED AND POWER WIRING DONE 
HERE IS IMAGE TO SHOW WHAT I DONE

ALL THE MAIN MCU CONNECTION DONE   

## 12/31/2025 10 AM - Flash memory and OTG Port   

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

Hi guys I'm not kidding it's 5 hour work 
I unable to find the Flash memory used in ESP32 Anywhere ON DOCS 
After 2.5 HR I decided to To remove the protective shield from my existing ESP32 Board and see what's there

I Found that it consists of GigaDevice GD25Q128ESIG Flasher Memory

AND I ADD IT INTO THE Systematic

 and made the connexion and I also added a The diode to protect it FROM Electronic spike And added to usb port One is for OTG and the second one is for Serial communication Otg part is done now I'm working on the serial communication.  

## 12/31/2025 1 PM - Systematic done!  

_Time spent: 3.4h_  

Show after facing many issues I finally completed Systematic of the custom And It really difficult Because Some component Are not disclosed by the official Which I have to find And use it

## 1/1/2026 4 AM - component placement  

_Time spent: 3.8h_  

So finally I completed The component placement And here's the image so you can take a look -

here is board

i know this process not take that much time but due to the compact size 
Beginning of my PCB designing it take time
  

## 1/1/2026 3 PM - routed the pcb   

_Time spent: 6.3h_  

So what I in our previous post I place all the components on the place and he starte route And here's the good news all root is completed. Give a good round of applause to me
